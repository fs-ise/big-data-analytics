## Why is Modern Analytics so Successful?

1. More Data for the Analysis
2. More Computing Power
3. New Methods and Algorithms
4. New Analytics Processes

# Computing Power {data-stack-name="Computing Power"}

## Growth of Computing Power

The rapid acceleration of computing power—driven by advances in hardware, cloud infrastructure, and parallel processing—has enabled modern analytics and machine learning to scale to massive datasets.

## ImageNet

ImageNet is a large-scale image recognition competition where models compete to classify millions of images across thousands of categories. Breakthrough models have historically demonstrated major advances in deep learning.: Models vs Human Baseline


```{python}
#| echo: false
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data from winning entries (2010–2017)
years = ["2010", "2011", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2016", "2017"]
models = ["NEC-UIUC", "XRCE", "AlexNet/\nSupervision",
          "ZFNet", "GoogLeNet", "T-S", "SEN"]
error_rates = [28.2, 25.8, 16.34, 11.7, 6.7, 3.0, 2.25]
human_error = 5.1

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 4))
x = range(len(years))
ax.bar(x, error_rates)

ax.set_xticks(x)
ax.set_xticklabels(models, rotation=30, ha="right")
ax.set_ylabel("Top-5 error rate (%)")
ax.set_ylim(0, 30)
ax.set_title("Error rates of winning ImageNet entries")

fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Same data
years = ["2010", "2011", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2016", "2017"]
models = ["NEC-UIUC", "XRCE", "AlexNet/\nSupervision",

human_error = 5.1

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 4))
x = range(len(years))
ax.bar(x, error_rates)

ax.axhline(human_error, linestyle="--")
ax.text(len(years)-0.5, human_error + 0.3,
        f"Human error rate ({human_error}%)",
        ha="right", va="bottom")

ax.set_xticklabels(models, rotation=30, ha="right")

## Types of Analytics (II)


**Descriptive**

- What happened in the past?  
- Example: Report the profits of the last years.

**Predictive**

- Find patterns and relationships in data and use them for prediction.  
- Example: Find the functional relationship between price and demand.

**Prescriptive**

- Use the predictions to make decisions.  
- Example: Set the best price to optimize the profit.



## Types of Analytics (III)

<div class="much_smaller">

| What happened? (descriptive / BI) | What will happen? (predictive analytics) | What should I do? (prescriptive analytics) |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| How many widgets did I sell last month? | How many widgets will I sell next month? | Order **5,000** units of Component Z to support widget sales for next month. |
| What were sales by zip code for Christmas last year? | What will be sales by zip code over this Christmas season? | Hire **Y** new sales reps by these zip codes to handle projected Christmas sales. |
| How many of Product X were returned last month? | How many of Product X will be returned next month? | Set aside **$125K** in financial reserve to cover Product X returns. |
| What were company revenues and profits for the past quarter? | What are projected company revenues and profits for next quarter? | Sell the following product mix to achieve quarterly revenue and margin goals. |
| How many employees did I hire last year? | How many employees will I need to hire next year? | Increase hiring pipeline by **35%** to achieve hiring goals. |

## Descriptive Analytics Process

## Predictive Analytics Process

## Example Inventory Planning

![](../images/slides_25.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

<p>On the basis of more than 300 million data records per week, Otto makes more than one billion forecasts per year on the sales development of individual articles for the next days and weeks. Such forecasts allow Otto to reduce its own inventories by up to 30% on average.</p>

## Example Driver-based Planing (II)

![](../images/slides-28-new.png){fig-align="center" width="40%"}

1. Sales forecasts based on market and social media data
2. Automated pricing based on market and competitor analyses
3. Early detection of price changes and adjustment of purchasing behavior
4. Optimization of inventory management based on customers' current purchasing preferences

## Summary

- Modern analytics is driven by data availability, computing power, and new methods.
- Analytics evolves from descriptive to predictive and prescriptive insights.
- Modern processes rely on automation, scalability, and data-driven decision making.
