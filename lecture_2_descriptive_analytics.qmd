<span style="color:#000000">Definition: </span>  <span style="color:#000000">Data Warehouse</span>

<span style="color:#000000">The term Data Warehouse was coined by Bill Inmon in 1990\, which he defined in the following way:  </span>

<span style="color:#000000">"A data warehouse is a subject\-oriented\, integrated\, time\-variant and non\-volatile collection of data in support of management's decision making process\."</span>

<span style="color:#000000">He defined the terms in the sentence as follows:</span>

<span style="color:#000000">Subject Oriented: </span>  <span style="color:#000000">Data that gives information about a particular subject instead of about a company's ongoing operations\.</span>  <span style="color:#000000"> </span>

<span style="color:#000000">Integrated: </span>  <span style="color:#000000">Data that is gathered into the data warehouse from a variety of sources and merged into a coherent whole\. </span>

<span style="color:#000000">Time\-variant: </span>  <span style="color:#000000">All data in the data warehouse is identified with a particular time period\. </span>

<span style="color:#000000">Non\-volatile: </span>  <span style="color:#000000">Data is stable in a data warehouse\. More data is added but data is never removed\. This enables management to gain a consistent picture of the business</span>

Structure of the Database

The database represents the core of the data warehouse\. It contains current and historical data from all relevant areas of the company\.  In contrast to the operational databases\, the data here is not structured according to the business processes and functions of the company\, but is aligned with the facts that determine the company\. They are organized in such a way that they can be viewed from different dimensions\.

Frequently used dimensions are:

Company structure \(e\.g\.\, business units\, organizational structure\, and legal entities\)

Product structure \(e\.g\. product groups and individual products\)

Regional structure \(e\.g\. region\, country\, continent\)

Customer structure \(e\.g\. customer groups or segments and individual customers\)

Time structure \(e\.g\. month\, quarter\, year\)

Business parameters \(e\.g\. sales\, contribution margin\, profit\)

Characteristics \(e\.g\. target\, actual\, deviations\)

---


The data in the data warehouse can normally only be accessed in a read\-only manner\. The only exception to this are ETL tools\, which are responsible for transferring data from internal and external information sources\. They automate the process of data acquisition from internal and external information sources\.

The timeliness with which the transfer to the database is to take place can be defined flexibly\, e\.g\. within defined time intervals\, immediately after each change or at the explicit request of the user\.

ETL programs include:

Monitors: Detect and report changes in individual sources that are relevant to the data warehouse

Extractors: select and transport data from the data sources into the workspace

Transformers: Unify\, clean\, integrate\, consolidate\, aggregate\, and augment extracted data in the workspace

Loaders: Load transformed data from the workspace into the data warehouse after the data retrieval process is complete


---


The staging area is a temporary cache that performs the ETL process\. It includes the extraction\, transformation and loading of the data into the data warehouse\.

Neither the operational systems nor the data warehouse are affected by the process\. The data can be transferred incrementally from the operational systems without having to have a permanent connection to them\. It is stored temporarily and only transformed when it is sufficiently complete\.

It is then loaded en bloc into the data warehouse\, so that no inconsistencies can occur here either\.

If the ETL process is successful\, the data is deleted from the staging area\.


---


The Metadata Repository

Metadata supports data management and serves as a descriptor for an object that holds some data or information\. In data warehouses\, it is collectively organized in a catalog called metadata repository\.

Metadata is classified into three types:

Technical metadata gives information about the structure of data\, where it resides\, and other technical details related to finding data in its native database\.

Business metadata describes the actual data in terms\, which is understandable from the business side\. It can provide insights into the type of data\, its origin\, its definition\, its quality level\, the relationship among other entities in a data warehouse\, etc\.

Process metadata stores information about the occurrence and outcomes of all the operations taking place in the data warehouse\.

The Star schema has a central fact table and exactly one dimension table for each dimension\.

The cardinality between the fact table and a dimension table is n∶1\, i\.e\. a fact \(e\.g\. sales: 67\,000 euros\) is described by one dimension expression for each dimension \(e\.g\. time: 1st quarter\, region: Hesse\, product group: books\)\. A dimension characteristic \(e\.g\. product group: books\) is associated with 0\, 1 or n facts\.

Star Schema Example

![](images/slides_44.png)


---


An online wine retailer plans to design a data warehouse to collect key figures regarding its wine sales\. The relevant part of the operational database consists of the following tables:

CUSTOMER \(ID\, name\, address\, telephone\, birthday\, gender\)

WINE \(ID\, name\, type\, year\, bottle\_price\, class\)

CLASS \(ID\, name\, region\)

TIME \(timestamp\, date\, year\)

ORDER \(customer\, wine\, time\, bottles\)

Create the star schema for the data warehouse\.

Queries on the Star Schema

Example:

In which years were the most cars purchased by female customers in Hesse in the 1st quarter?

select 	z\.Year as Year\, sum\(v\.Amount\) as Total\_Amount

from 	Branch f\, Product p\, Time z\, Customer k\, Sales v

where 	z\.Quarter = 1 and k\.gender = ’f’ and p\.Product\_type = ’Car’ and f\.state = ’Hesse’ and v\.Date = z\.Date and v\.ProductID = p\.ProductID andv\.Branch = f\.Branchname and v\.CustomerID = k\.CustomerID

A restaurant chain wants to build a management information system\. The application system architecture is to be aligned with the data warehouse concept\. An OLAP system is chosen for report generation\.

The company maintains various restaurants\, which can be differentiated by region and by renovation status\. The Leonardo\-Campus restaurant belongs to the North region and is New from the renovation status\. The restaurant Nordblick is also located in the North region\, but its renovation status is Old\. The Spätzleburg restaurant\, on the other hand\, is in the South region and has a New renovation status\.

The menu items of the restaurants are divided into the classes "Starters"\, "Main courses"\, "Desserts"\, "Beverages" and "Other"\. Time\-based analyses are to enable evaluations by days of the week\, weeks\, months and years\. Simple contribution margin calculations for restaurants\, services and days are to be supported\. The contribution margin is mathematically calculated from sales minus costs\.

As an employee of the Controlling department\, you will be given the task of setting up a data warehouse for sales and headcount analyses\.

Flowers GmbH has two branches in Hesse\, one in Rhineland\-Palatinate and three in France\. Product categories include cut flowers\, garden flowers and bridal jewelry\. Within garden flowers\, the rose family includes the genera roses and wild roses\. Products in the rose genus include thornless roses and roses with thorns\. The company distinguishes between corporate and private customers\. Data about the place of residence of the customers is available\.

The DWH should be able to generate daily and weekly analyses as well as monthly\, quarterly and annual reports\.

The key figure required for the sales analyses is the profit\, which is calculated from the difference between revenues and costs\.

Employees have been working in the different branches of the company for different periods of time\. The DWH should also enable headcount analyses\. The key figure required for this is the headcount\.
