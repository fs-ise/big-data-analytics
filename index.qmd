Some of the following will be moved to the [syllabus](syllabus.html).
:::

This module introduces students to the methods, technologies, and governance of modern data analytics across descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive approaches. It builds a comprehensive understanding of the data analytics process—from data structuring and preparation to exploratory data analysis, analytical modeling, and decision support.
The module combines conceptual foundations and hands-on analytical practice using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn. It progresses from structured transactional data (data warehouses, OLAP, data mining) to big and unstructured data (text, social, streaming). Emphasis is placed on the fit between data types, analytical models, and decision purposes, as well as the ability to design, evaluate, and govern analytical systems in organizations.

## Learning objectives

**Knowledge** After completing the module, students will be able to:

- Describe architectures for data warehousing and big data processing, with reference to the underlying data modeling concepts.
- Differentiate between descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics approaches.
- Explain fundamental concepts of data analytics, and its role in data-driven organizations.

**Skills** Students will be able to:

- Select appropriate analytical methods for transactional or non-transactional data, and for descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis tasks.
- Apply analytical methods to real-world datasets, including structuring, transforming, and visualizing data. This also involves training models, evaluating performance, and interpreting analytical results for decision-making.
- Implement analytical procedures in Python, using standard data science libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib).

**Competence** Upon successful completion, students will be able to:

- Design analytics solutions aligned with business goals and governance principles.
- Integrate analytical technologies into organizational decision-making processes
- Assess the operational and strategic implications of data analytics in organizations.
