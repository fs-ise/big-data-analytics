## Need for Knowledge about the Algorithms

<p style="font-weight:700; font-size:1.8em;">The distance between using Excel and VBA for modeling in credit scoring, for example, and using machine learning algorithms and R or Python to enhance the results, is not that great, compared to the distance between someone running a packaged algorithm they don’t really understand and someone who understands the mathematical and statistical operations within an algorithm and can optimize or adapt it as needed – and do so in the context of their deep industry experience.

## Statistics vs\. Machine Learning

 <span style="font-size:1.7em"><strong>Statistics</strong> about finding valid conclusions about the underlying applied theory\, and on the interpretation of parameters in their models\. It insists on proper and rigorous methodology\, and is comfortable with making and noting assumptions\. It cares about how the data was collected and the resulting properties of the estimator or experiment \(e\.g\. p\-value\)\. The focus is on hypothesis testing\.</span>

<span style="font-size:1.7em"><strong>Machine Learning \(ML\)</strong> aims to derive practice\-relevant findings from existing data and to apply the trained models to data not previously seen \(prediction\)\. It tries to predict or classify with the most accuracy\. It cares deeply about scalability and uses the predictions to make decisions\. Much of ML is motivated by problems that need to have answers\. ML is happy to treat the algorithm as a black box as long as it works\. </span>

## Definitions

<div style="font-size:1.7em;font-weight:600">
A  <span style="color:#ff0000">method</span>  is a composition of formalized principles that form the basis for a stringent calculation process\.

An  <span style="color:#ff0000">algorithm</span>  is a procedure or set of steps or rules to accomplish a task\. It is usually the implementation of a method\. Algorithms are used to build models\.

In the given context\, a  <span style="color:#ff0000">model</span>  is the description of the relationship between variables\. It is used to create output data from given input data\, for example to make predictions\.

<span style="color:#ff0000">Fitting</span>  a model means that you estimate the model using the observed data\. You are using your data as evidence to help approximate the real\-world mathematical process that generated the data\. Fitting the model often involves optimization methods and algorithms\, such as maximum likelihood estimation\, to help get the parameters\.

<span style="color:#ff0000">Overfitting</span>  is the term used to mean that you used a dataset to estimate the parameters of your model\, but your model isn’t that good at capturing reality beyond your sampled data\.

<p style="color:#ff0000;font-size:1.6em;border:1px solid #ff0000;padding:10px !important">Due to the problem of overfitting\, the main goal is to maximize the prediction quality and not to fit the data that is used for the model estimation as well as possible\.

## The Bias\-Variance Tradeoff

<div style="display:flex;">
<div style="font-size:1.5em;font-weight:600;width:60%">
The prediction error is influenced by three components:

<p style="text-align:center">Error = Bias \+ Variance \+ Noise</p>

Bias is the inability of the used method to learn the relevant relations between the inputs and the outputs\. It reflects the method quality\, e\.g\. if a method only produces linear models\.

Variance is represents the deviation resulting from the sensitivity of the created model to small fluctuations in the data\.

Typically\, there is a tradeoff between bias and variance\.

Noise is everything that arises from random variations in the data\. It cannot be controlled\.

## Which Method should I choose?

<div style="font-size:1.7em;font-weight:700">
The choice of the method of data analysis depends on the one hand on the scope of application\, but on the other hand on the interrelationships of the data to be analyzed\.

In the Big Data area\, data spaces are often highly\-dimensional\, making it difficult to visualize the interrelationships\.

For this reason\, the choice of the method can often not be made ex ante\. In these cases\, different methods are competitively tried to select the most suitable one\.

## Sampling

<div style="font-weight:700;font-size:1.6em">
A population can be defined as including all people or items with the characteristic one wishes to understand\.

Sampling is about to find a representative subset of that population\.

Data represents the traces of the real\-world processes\, and exactly which traces we gather are decided by our sampling method\.

There are two sources of randomness and uncertainty:

<ol>

<li>the randomness and uncertainty underlying the process itself\, and
</li>
<li>the uncertainty associated with the underlying sampling method\.
</li>
</ol>
</div>


---


## Sampling in Times of Big Data

<div style="font-size:1.7em; font-weight:700">
Question:

Is there any need for sampling in times of Big Data? Why not "N=ALL"?

Answer:

Data is not objective\! Data does not speak for itself\. Data is just a quantitative echo of the events of our society\.

Examples:

<ul class="disc-list">

<li>
When analyzing the probability of customers terminating the relationship\, a very small proportion of terminating customers \(e\.g\. 0\.2%\) on the whole may result in a bias\.
</li>
<li>
When analyzing political attitudes via social media data\, there might be a bias if people with specific attitudes are posting more frequently\.
</li>
</ul>

</div>

---


## Reasons for Sampling

<ul class="disc-list" style="font-size:1.7em;font-weight:600">
<li>
The volume of data is too large to capture and process
</li>
<li>
Design the analytics process using a subset of the data for performance reasons\. Later use the complete data set\.
</li>
<li>
The data set doesn't perfectly represent the target population\.
</li>
<li>
The data set is imbalanced\.
</li>
<li>
Use sampling to partition into training and test data\.
</li>
<li>

## Feature Engineering

<div style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:700;margin-bottom:3em">
<span style="color:#000000">Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work\. If feature engineering is done correctly\, it increases the predictive power of machine learning algorithms by creating features from raw data that help facilitate the machine learning process\. </span>

<span style="color:#000000">A feature \(variable\, attribute\) is depicted by a column in a dataset\. Considering a generic two\-dimensional dataset\, each observation is depicted by a row and each feature by a column\, which will have a specific value for an observation:</span>
<div style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_144_new.png)
</div>
<span style="color:#000000">Features can be of two major types\. </span>  <span style="color:#ff0000">Raw features</span>  <span style="color:#000000"> are obtained directly from the dataset with no extra data manipulation or engineering\. </span>  <span style="color:#ff0000">Derived features</span>  <span style="color:#000000"> are usually obtained from feature engineering\, where we extract features from existing data attributes\. A simple example would be creating a new feature “Age” from an employee dataset containing "Birthdate"\.</span>

## Variants of Feature Engineering

<div style="font-size:1.2em">
  <h3>1.\ Transformation</h3>
  <ul class="disc-list">
    <li>convert features (e.g., birth date → age)</li>
    <li>build lag structures (e.g., time-lags)</li>
    <li>normalization / standardization / scaling</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.\ Type Conversion</h3>
  <ul class="disc-list">
    <li>if numerical type is needed, transform categorical into numerical data using dummy features</li>
    <li>if categorical type is needed or more informative, discretize numerical features (e.g., income → poor / rich classes)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.\ Feature Combination</h3>
  <ul class="disc-list">
    <li>create interaction features (e.g., school_score = num_schools × median_school  
      with num_schools = number of schools within 5 miles of a property and  
      median_school = median quality score of those schools)
    </li>
    <li>combine categories (e.g., when there are very few observations or too many dummy features)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4.\ Feature Composition</h3>
  <ul class="disc-list">
    <li>build ratios (e.g., returns from prices)</li>
    <li>Principal Component Analysis (Dimensionality Reduction)</li>
  </ul>

</div>


---

## Scaling

<div style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:700">
<p style="color:#000000">Most datasets contain features highly varying in magnitudes\, units and range\.</p>
<p>Most machine learning algorithms have problems with this because they use distance measures or calculate gradients\. The features with high magnitudes will weigh in a lot more in the distance calculations than features with low magnitudes and gradients may end up taking a long time or are not accurately calculable\.</p>
<p style="color:#000000">To overcome this effect\, we scale the features to bring them to the same level of magnitudes\. The two most discussed scaling methods are Normalization and Standardization\. </p>

## Type Conversion \(Encoding\)

<div style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:700">
<span style="color:#000000">Many machine learning algorithms cannot work with categorical data directly\. To convert categorical data to numbers\, there exist two variants:</span>

<span style="color:#ff0000">Label encoding</span>  <span style="color:#000000"> refers to transforming the word labels into numerical form so that the algorithms can understand how to operate on them\. Every categorical value is assigned to one numerical value\, e\.g\. young \-> 1\, </span>  <span style="color:#000000">middle\_age</span>  <span style="color:#000000"> \-> 2\, old \-> 3\. This only works in specific situations where you have somewhat continuous\-like data\, e\.g\. if the categorical feature is ordinal\.</span>

<span style="color:#ff0000">One hot encoding</span>  <span style="color:#000000"> is a representation of a categorical variable as binary vectors\. Every categorical value is assigned to an artificial binary variable\. If the corresponding categorical value occurs in a data row the value of its binary replacement is equal to 1 else 0\, e\.g\. </span>
<div style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_147_new.png)
</div>
<span style="color:#000000">It is usual when creating dummy variables to have one less variable than the number of categories present to avoid perfect collinearity \(dummy variable trap\)\.</span>
</div>


---


## Example of Feature Engineering \(I\)

<div style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:700">
<p style="color:#000000">Data sets often contain date/time features\. These features are rarely useful in their original form because they only contain ongoing values\. However\, they can be useful for extracting cyclical factors\, such as weekly or seasonal effects\. Suppose\, we are given a data "flight date time vs status"\. Then\, given the date\-time data\, we have to predict the status of the flight\.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_183.png)
</div>
<p style="color:#000000">But the status of the flight may depend on the hour of the day\, not on the date\-time\. To analyze this\, we will create the new feature " Hour\_Of\_Day"\. Using the "Hour\_Of\_Day" feature\, the machine will learn better as this feature is directly related to the status of the flight\.</p>

## Example of Feature Engineering \(II\)

<div style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:700">
<span style="color:#000000">Suppose we are given the latitude\, longitude and other data with the objective to predict the target feature "</span>  <span style="color:#000000">Price\_Of\_House</span>  <span style="color:#000000">"\. Latitude and longitude are not of use in this context if they are alone\. So\, we will combine the latitude and the longitude to make one feature\. </span>

<span style="color:#000000">In other cases\, it might be appropriate to transform latitude and longitude into categories which reflect regions\, for example</span>

## Partitioning the Data



<div style="font-size:1.5em;font-weight:600">
<p>
The partitioning of the data in <span style="color:#ff0000">Training and Test Data</span>  has the aim to proof if the analytical results can be generalized. The analysis (e.g. the development of a classifier) is carried out on the basis of training data. Subsequently, the results are applied to the test data. If the results are significantly worse than the training data, the model is not generalizable, which is called overfitting.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_186.png)
</div>
<p>
The partitioning of the data in training and test data can be carried out in the following ways: 
<ul class="disc-list">
<li>By random/stratified/... sampling (problem with the repeatability)
</li>
<li>according to a list
</li>
<li>according to rules (e.g. the first/last 50 records or every twelfth)
</li>
</ul>

## Exploratory Data Analysis

<div style="font-size:1.5em;font-weight:600">
In Exploratory Data Analysis \(EDA\)\, there is no hypothesis and there is no model\.

People are not very good at looking at a column of numbers or a whole data table and then determining important characteristics of the data\. EDA techniques have been devised as an aid in this situation\.

Reasons for EDA:

&#x25CF; gain intuition about the data

&#x25CF; make comparisons between distributions

&#x25CF; sanity checking \(making sure the data is on the scale you expect\, in the format you thought it should be\)

&#x25CF; find out where data is missing or if there are outliers

&#x25CF; summarize the data

Exploratory data analysis is generally cross\-classed in two ways\. First\, each method is either non\-graphical or graphical\. And second\, each method is either univariate or multivariate\.

</div>

---


## Univariate Non\-Graphical EDA

<div style="font-size:1.5em;font-weight:600">
Non\-graphical exploratory data analysis is the first step when beginning to analyze the data\. This preliminary data analysis step focuses on four points:

&#x25CF; measures of central tendency\, i\.e\. mean and median\. The median\, known as 50th percentile\, is more resistant to outliers\.

&#x25CF; measures of spread\, i\.e\. variance\, standard deviation\, and interquartile range

&#x25CF; the shape of the distribution

&#x25CF; the existence of outliers

The characteristics of interest for a categorical variable are simply the range of values and the frequency of occurrence for each value\.

<div style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_188.png)
</div>
</div>


---


## Tests on Outliers

<div style="font-size:1.5em;font-weight:600">
Outlier are data objects\, which are clearly different from the others\.

Usually\, the detection of outliers is an unsupervised process\, because they are not known before analyses\.

In the case of  <span style="color:#ff0000">numerical attributes</span>  the Interquartil Range can be used\. Here\, an outlier is defined if the attribute lies outside the interval
<div style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_187_new.png)
</div>



Usually\, k has a value between 1\.5 and 3\. The bigger k\, the more different  the values must be to be classified as outliers\.

Can be visualized by a Box\-and\-Whisker Plot:
<div style="text-align:right">
![](images/slides_189.png)
</div>
</div>


---


## Handling Outliers

<div style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:600">
* Outlier have to be  <span style="color:#ff0000">eliminated</span>  if they
  * 1.\ would bias the analysis\, e\.g\. if 9 persons have an age between 20 and 30 and the 10th person is 80 years old\.
  * 2.\ are erogenous data\, e\.g\. as a result of input errors or a defect sensor\.
* It is not always acceptable to drop an observation just because it is an outlier\.  They can be legitimate observations and are sometimes interesting ones\.  It’s important to investigate the nature of the outlier before deciding\.
* In those cases where you shouldn’t drop the outlier\, one option is to try a transformation\.  <span style="color:#ff0000">Log transformations </span> pull in high numbers\.  This can reduce the impact of a single point if the outlier is an independent variable\.

## Univariate Graphical EDA

<div style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:600">
Non\-graphical and graphical EDA methods complement each other\, they have the same focus\. While the non\-graphical methods are quantitative and objective\, they do not give a full picture of the data\. The distribution of a variable tells us what values the variable takes and how often each value occurs\.

Types of displays:

for numerical variables: Histograms\, Boxplots\, Quantile\-normal plots\, …

for categorical variables: Pie charts\, Bar graphs\, …

## Reinforcement Learning

<div style="font-size:1.5em;font-weight:600">
The solution to many of the problems in our lives cannot be automated\. This is not because current computers are too slow\, but simply because it is too difficult for humans to determine what the program should do\.

Supervised learning is a general method for training an approximator\. However\, supervised learning requires sample input\-output pairs from the domain to be learned\.

For example\, we might not know the best way to program a computer to recognize an infrared picture of a tank\, but we do have a large collection of infrared pictures\, and we do know whether each picture contains a tank or not\. Supervised learning could look at all the examples with answers\, and learn how to recognize tanks in general\.

Unfortunately\, there are many situations where we don’t know the correct answers that supervised learning requires\. For example\, in a self\-driving car\, the question would be the set of all sensor readings at a given time\, and the answer would be how the controls should react during the next millisecond\.

For these cases there exist a different approach known as reinforcement learning\.

## AlphaGo

<div style="font-size:1.6em;font-weight:600">
Go is one of the hardest games in the world for AI because of the huge number of different game scenarios and moves\. The number of potential legal board positions is greater than the number of atoms in the universe\.

<div style="display:flex;">
<div style="width:50%">
The core of AlphaGo is a deep neural network\. It was initially trained to learn playing by using a database of around 30 million recorded historical moves\. After the training\, the system was cloned and it was trained further playing large numbers of games against other instances of itself\, using reinforcement learning to improve its play\. During this training AlphaGo learned new strategies which were never played by humans\.

A newer version named AlphaGo Zero skips the step of being trained and learns to play simply by playing games against itself\, starting from completely random play\.

## Libratus

<div style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:600">
An artificial intelligence called Libratus has beaten four of the world’s best poker players in a grueling 20\-day tournament in January 2017\.

Poker is more difficult because it’s a game with imperfect information\. With chess and Go\, each player can see the entire board\, but with poker\, players don’t get to see each other’s hands\. Furthermore\, the AI is required to bluff and correctly interpret misleading information in order to win\.

“We didn’t tell Libratus how to play poker\. We gave it the rules of poker and said ‘learn on your own’\.” The AI started playing randomly but over the course of playing trillions of hands was able to refine its approach and arrive at a winning strategy\.

## Types of Artificial Intelligence

<div style="font-size:1.7em;font-weight:600">
<span style="color:#ff0000">Discriminative AI</span>  is designed to differentiate and classify input\, but not to create new content\. Examples include image or speech recognition\, credit scoring or stock price prediction\.

<span style="color:#ff0000">Generative AI</span>  is able to generate new content based on existing information and user specifications\. This includes texts\, images\, videos\, program code\, etc\. The generated content can often hardly be distinguished from human\-generated content\. As things stand at present\, however\, they are pure recombinations of learned knowledge\.

Well\-known examples of generative AI are language models for generating text\, such as GPT\-3 or GPT\-4\, and the chatbot ChatGPT based on them\, or image generators such as Stable Diffusion and DALL\-E\.
</div>


---

## ChatGPT

<div style="font-size:1.8em;font-weight:600">
ChatGPT is a generative AI that produces human\-like text and communicates with humans\.

The "GPT" in ChatGPT comes from the language model of the same name\, which was extended for ChatGPT with various components for communication and quality assurance\.

GPT is based on a huge neural network that essentially represents the language model\. While the first GPT\-3 has 175 billion parameters\, the newer GPT\-4 already has 1 trillion parameters\. Compared to GPT\-3\, GPT\-4 is therefore more intelligent\, can deal with more extensive questions and conversations and makes fewer factual errors\.

## ChatGPT \- Approach

<div style="font-size:1.6em;font-weight:600">
ChatGPT generates its response word by word via a sequence of probabilities\, with each new word depending on the previous ones\.

The most probable word is not always selected; instead\, randomization takes place\. This means that different variants can be created for the same task\.

Credit\-Scoring is a typical example for a classification problem\. A bank wants to determine the creditworthiness of a customer\.

<div style="float:left;width:60%">
Assume you have the age\, income\, and a creditworthiness category of "yes" or "no" for a bunch of people and you want to use the age and income to predict the creditworthiness for a new person\.

You can plot people as points on the plane and label people with an empty circle if they have low credit ratings\.

What if a new guy comes in who is 49years old and who makes 53\,000 Euro? What is his likely credit rating label?

## k\-Nearest Neighbors


<div style="font-size:1.6em;font-weight:600">
* k\-Nearest Neighbors \(k\-NN\) is an algorithm that can be used when you have a bunch of objects that have been classified or labeled in some way\, and other similar objects that have not gotten classified or labeled yet\, and you want a way to automatically label them\.
* The intuition behind k\-NN is to consider the most similar other items defined in terms of their attributes\, look at their labels\, and give the unassigned item the majority vote\. If there’s a tie\, you randomly select among the labels that have tied for first\.
* <span style="color:#1a1a1a">Procedure of k\-NN:</span>
  * <span style="color:#1a1a1a">1. Determine parameter k \(= number of nearest neighbors\)</span>
  * <span style="color:#1a1a1a">2. Calculate the distances between the new object and all known labeled  objects\.</span>

## Evaluating the quality of Classification \(I\)

<div style="font-size:1.6em;font-weight:600">
True positives \(TP\)\, true negatives \(TN\)\, false positives \(FP\)\, and false negatives \(FN\)\, are the four different possible outcomes of a single prediction for a two\-class case\. A false positive is when the outcome is incorrectly classified as "yes"\, when it is in fact "no"\. A false negative is when the outcome is incorrectly classified as negative\, when it is in fact positive\. True positives and true negatives are obviously correct classifications\.

Most classification algorithms pursue to minimize the misclassification rate\. They implicitly assume that all misclassification errors cost equally\.

## Problem of Imbalancing and Accuracy

<div style="font-size:1.6em;font-weight:600">
Assume the following case: A credit card company wants to create a fraud detection system to include it into their transactional systems\. The outcomes should be "Accept" \(Y\) and "Reject" \(N\)\. Because fraud rarely occurs\, the data set consists of 320 observations for Y and 139 for N\. They are partitioned into training and test set\. Finally\, the model is trained and tested\.

Because of the majority of the Y class\, the training process concentrates on these cases because their correct classification promises the highest accuracy\.

The results of the test of the model is consequently:

::: {.notes}

To choose the relevant features, you can apply several methods and after this you may train a selection model using for example logistic regression. The whole process would be very time-consuming and even costly. As an alternative, you can apply a decision tree algorithm which is a stepwise or recursive classification mechanism. 

Proportions in the leafs can be interpreted as probabilities.

## Decision Trees \(I\)

<div style="font-size:1.6em;font-weight:600">
Decision trees belong to the hierarchical methods of classification\. They analyze step\-by\-step \(recursive partitioning\)\.

A decision tree consists of nodes and borders\. The topmost node \(without any parent node\) is called "root"\. A node without a child node is called "leaf"\. Nodes that have parent and  child nodes are called "interior nodes"\. The interior nodes represent the splitting of the included object sets\. An interior node has at least two child nodes \(sons\)\. If every interior node has exactly two child nodes\, the tree is called a "binary tree"\.

A decision tree method starts at the root\, which includes all objects\. The different features are compared \(with an adequate measure\) regarding their suitability of classification\. The most appropriate feature determines the branching of the current set of objects: regarding this feature\, the current set of objects is divided into disjoint subsets \(partitioning\)\. This method is now used recursively to the created child nodes \(subsets\)\.
</div>


---


## Decision Trees \(II\)

<div style="font-size:1.6em;font-weight:600">
<p>
Graphically\, decision tree models divide the dataspace in a large number of subspaces and search for the variables which are able to split the dataspace with the greatest homogeneity\. We can think of the decision tree as a map of different path\. For a distinct combination of predictor variables and their observed values\, we would enter a specific path\, which gives the classification in the leaf of the decision tree\.
</p>
<div style="float:left;width:50%">
The decision tree approach does not require any assumption about the functional form of variables or distributions\. Furthermore in contrast to parametric models like linear regressions\, the decision tree algorithm can model multiple structures as well as complex relationships within the data\, which would be difficult to replicate in a linear model\.

</div>

## Calculating the Information Gain

<div style="font-size:1.6em;font-weight:600">
The information gain is a measure, that shows (by combination of the entropies) the appropriateness of an attribute for splitting:
<div style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_207_1_new.png)
</div>
where m = number of values (here two: light, strong), ti = number of data sets with strong or light wind (8 resp. 6), t = total number of data sets (14) and entropy(t) = entropy before splitting.
<div style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_207_2_new.png)
</div>
</div>

---


## Decision using ID3

<div style="font-size:1.6em;font-weight:600">
Information gain \(outlook\) = 0\.246

Information gain \(humidity\) = 0\.151

Information gain \(wind\) = 0\.048

Information gain \(temperature\) = 0\.029

We choose the attribute with the largest information gain \(here: outlook\) for the first splitting\.

As solution we obtain the following tree:

<div style="text-align:center;margin-top:2em">
![](images/slides_243.png)
</div>
</div>


---


## Decision using C5\.0

<div style="font-size:1.3em;font-weight:600">
<p>ID3 tends to favor attributes that have a large number of values, resulting in larger trees. For example, if we have an attribute that has a distinct value for each record, then the entropy is 0, thus the information gain is maximal. </p>
<p>To compensate for this, C5.0 is a further development that uses the information gain ratio as a splitting criterion:</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_209_new.png)
</div>
<p>In the case of our example the GainRatio of Windy is</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_209_2_new.png)
</div>
<p>
and the GainRatio of Outlook is 
</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_209_2_new.png)
</div>
</div>

---


## Handling Numerical Attributes

<div style="font-size:1.6em;font-weight:600">

<p>Numerical attributes are usually splitted binary. In contrast to categorical attributes many possible splitting points exist .</p>
<p>The splitting point with the highest information gain is looked for. For this, the potential attribute is sorted according to its values first and then all possible splitting point and the corresponding information gains are calculated. In extreme cases there exists n-1 possibilities. </p>
<div style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_210_new.png)
</div>
</div>

---


## The CART Algorithm

<div style="font-size:1.6em;font-weight:600">
<p>The CART algorithm (Classification And Regression Trees) constructs trees that have only binary splits. Like C5.0, it is able to handle categorical and  numerical attributes. </p>
<p>As a measure for the impurity of a node t, CART uses the Gini Index. In the case of two classes the Gini Index is defined as:</p>

<p style="color:#000000;font-size:1.6em"> __Remark: Entropy has been scaled from \(0\, 1\) to \(0\, 0\.5\)\!__ </p>
</div>

---

## Overfitting (I)

<div style="font-size:1.6em;font-weight:600">
<div>
<p>Most decision tree algorithms partition training data until every node contains objects of a single class, or until further partitioning is impossible because two objects have the same value for each attribute but belong to different classes. If there are no such conflicting objects, the decision tree will correctly classify all training objects.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="float:left;width:65%">If tree performance is measured from the number of correctly classified cases it is com-mon to find that the training data gives an over-optimistic guide to future performance,i.e. with new data. A tree should exhibit generalization, i.e. work well with data other than those used to generate it. When the tree grows during training it often shows a decrease in generalization. This is because the deeper nodes are fitting noise in the training data not representative over the entire universe from which the training set was sampled. This is called 'overfitting'.

## Logistic regression \(I\)

<div style="font-size:1.6em;font-weight:600">
Logistic regression is a regression model where the dependent variable is categorical\. The classical logistic regression is a binary classifier\, where the dependent variable has two states\. The output of a logistic regression model ranges between 0 and 1\.

Logistic regression uses the logistic function \(or Sigmoid function\) because it can take an input with any value from negative to positive infinity\, whereas the output always takes values between zero and one and hence is interpretable as a probability\.

## Logistic regression \(II\)


<div>

</div>

<div style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:600">
We interpret F\(x\) as the conditional probability that the class attribute has the value 1 with the given input vector x\.

The coefficients &beta;<sub>0</sub> and &beta; can be estimated via Maximum Likelihood Estimation\.

The parameter &beta;<sub>0</sub> represents the unconditional probability of "Y=1" knowing nothing about the feature vector x\.

The parameter vector &beta; defines the slope of the logit function\. It determines the extent to which certain features contribute for increased or decreased likelihood to "Y=1"\.

The output of a logistic model is a probability\. To use this for classification purposes:

If the predicted probability is > 0\.5 the label is 1

and otherwise 0\.

## Backpropagation

<div style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:600">
* The Backpropagation algorithm is used for calculating the weights\. In a training phase\, the weights are iteratively calculated using training data sets in such a way that the difference between the calculated and the expected \(true\) results is minimized\. Because the simultaneous calculation of all weights is not possible\, they must be found via a learning process\. The backpropagation algorithm looks for the minimum of the error function in weight space using the method of gradient descent\.
* The procedure in principle:
  * \(1\)	Define the initial weights
  * \(2\)	Put the training set into the input layer
  * \(3\)	Calculate the result \(value of the output layer\) via successive processing one layer after the other
  * \(4\)	Compare the output values and target values and calculate the difference
  * \(5\)	Iterate steps \(2\) to \(4\) for every training set
  * \(6\)	Calculate the total error\. Adjust the weights beginning with the output layer towards the input layer \(backpropagation\)
  * \(7\)	Iterate steps \(2\) to \(6\) until the total error reaches the defined error\-level or the number of maximum iterations is reached\.

## Principle of Gradient Descent \(I\)

<div style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:400">
<span style="color:#000000">Gradient descent is used to find the minimum of the error function</span>  <span style="color:#000000">\. It works iterative\. In an 1\-dimensional world\, we define the error by</span>
<p>error = &frac12; &middot; (prediction &minus; actual)<sup>2</sup></p>
<span style="color:#000000">The error function is at minimum if the error is equal to zero\.</span>

<span style="color:#000000">The prediction is the result of a combination of input and weight</span>

<span style="color:#000000">The weight as the dynamic component is now adjusted until the error is at minimum\. Starting</span>  <span style="color:#000000"> with an initial weight\, gradient descent jumps step by step into the minimum by adjusting the weight\. The adjustment is done by calculating the direction </span>  <span style="color:#000000">and</span>  <span style="color:#000000"> the amount for a step via</span>

## Principle of Gradient Descent \(II\)

<div style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:400">
<p>The formula </p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">deltaweight = (prediction - actual).input</p>
<p>represents the derivative of the error to the weight\.</p>

<p>A derivative is a term that is calculated as the slope \(or gradient\) of a graph at a particular point\. The slope is described by drawing a tangent line to the graph at the point\. So\, if we are able to compute this tangent line\, we might be able to compute the desired direction to reach the minima\.</p>

<p>Since the weight only indirectly affects the error\, the chain rule must be applied</p>

## Principle of Gradient Descent \(III\)

<div style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:400">
<p>Gradient Descent isn't perfect\. When the gradients are too big we might overshoot so much that we're even farther away than we started</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_238_new.png)
</div>

<p>This problem is destructive because overshooting this far means we land at an even steeper slope in the opposite direction\. This causes us to overshoot again even farther\.</p>

<p>If the gradients are too big\, we can make them smaller\. We do this by multiplying them by a single number between 0 and 1 \(such as 0\.01\)\. This fraction is typically named alpha\.</p>

<p>Thus\, the adjustment of the weights is done by</p>
<p style="margin-left:4em">weight = weight - <i>alpha</i> . deltaweight</p>

## Cross Validation in Time Series


<div style="font-size:1.6em;font-weight:600;">
  <p> In the case of time series\, classical cross validation may cause problems\. If we choose random samples and assign them to either the test set or the training set we are quickly in the situation of using values from the future to forecast values in the past\. But we want to avoid future\-looking when we train our model\. If there is a temporal dependency between observations\, we must preserve that relation during training and testing\.</p>
  <p style="display:flex"><span style="width:50%"> A procedure that can be used for cross validating a time series model is cross validation on a rolling basis\. Start with a small subset of data for training purpose\, forecast for the later data points and then check the accuracy for the forecasted data points\. The time frame for the forecast is then included as part of the next training dataset and subsequent data points are forecasted and so on\.</span><span style="width:50%">

  <p> Scikit\-learn provides a class _TimeSeriesSplit_  to do this\.</p>

## Measuring the Quality of Fit \(I\)

<div style="font-size:1.4em;font-weight:600;">
Measuring the quality of fit means to measure how well the predictions of a model match the observed data\.

A commonly\-used measure is the Mean Absolute Error \(MAE\) which can be calculated for the training and the test set
<p style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_269_new.png)
</p>
A variant is the Mean Absolute Percentage Error \(MAPE\) which expresses the error in percent
<p style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_268_2_new.png)
</p>
While MAE and MAPE are easily interpretable\, using the absolute value of the error often is not as desirable as squaring this difference\. Depending on how you want your model to treat outliers\, or extreme values\, in your data\, you may want to bring more attention to these outliers or downplay them\.

Consequently\, the most used measure in regression is the Mean Squared Error \(MSE\) or its variant the Root Mean Squared Error  \(RMSE\)\, which is the square root of the MSE\.
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
</div>

## Measuring the Quality of Fit \(II\)

<div style="font-size:1.3em;font-weight:600;">
An alternative measure is R<sup>2</sup>, which calculates the proportion of variance explained. It indicates how much better the model predicts compared to the mean ȳ as a naïve predictor 
<p style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_270_new.png)
</p>
As the formula shows, R<sup>2</sup> is a normalized version of MSE. Technically, it is the MSE divided by a constant that is case-dependent but the same for all the comparative models IF THE SAME DATA SET IS USED. In this case and only in this case, there can be no difference between R<sup>2</sup> and MSE in evaluating models. It is easier to interpret R2 compared to the MSE.

To measure the robustness, the formula is applied to the test set using the mean ȳ of the training set. This measure is named <span style="color:#ff0000;">Pseudo-R<sup>2</sup></span>
<p style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_270_2_new.png)
</p>

While R<sup>2</sup> is between 0 and 1, Pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> can also be less than 0 (but not greater than 1). In this case, the model is even worse in practical application than using ȳ would be.

## Ridge Regression

<div style="font-size:1.3em;font-weight:600;">
Ridge Regression is an enhancement of OLS using a technique that constrains or regularizes the coefficient estimates. This is done by shrinking the coefficient estimates towards zero resulting in a gain in robustness and a higher generalization ability.

Similar to OLS, Ridge Regression estimates the parameters of the function

<p style="text-align:center">
𝑦<sub>𝑖</sub> = 𝛽<sub>𝟎</sub> + 𝜷′𝒙<sub>𝑖</sub> + 𝜐<sub>𝑖</sub>
</p>

but instead of minimizing the residual sum of squares (𝜐<sup>2</sup>), the function to minimize is
<p style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_272_new.png)
</p>
where 𝜆 ≥ 0 is a tuning parameter, to be determined separately. It is called a shrinkage penalty and has the effect of shrinking the estimates of β<sub>j</sub> towards zero. This is equivalent to reducing complexity

<p style="color:#ff0000;">Remark: 𝜆 is not applied to the intercept 𝛽<sub>𝟎</sub>!</p>

## Relationship of 𝜆 and Complexity

<div style="font-size:1.3em;font-weight:600;">
𝜆 → ∞ : Lowest Complexity

the ridge regression coefficients are equal to zero\. For every input\, the result is β<sub>0</sub>\.

𝜆 = 0 : Relative High Complexity \(linear Model\)

the penalty term has no effect\, and ridge regression will produce the least squares estimates\.

## Handling High\-Dimensionality \(I\)

<div style="font-size:1.3em;font-weight:600;">
OLS is not suitable for high\-dimensional data\. Especially when the number of features p is as large as\, or larger than\, the number of observations\, OLS cannot be applied\. _ _ Regardless of whether or not there truly is a relationship between the features and the response\, OLS will yield a set of coefficient estimates that result in a perfect fit to the data\, such that the residuals are 	zero\.

<div style="display:flex;align-items:center;gap:2em">
![](images/slides_306.png)
<div>
<p style="color:#000000;font-weight:400">Source: </p>
<p style="color:#000000;font-weight:400">James et al\. \(2013\): An Introduction to Statistical Learning with R Applications\, p\. 239f\.</p>
</div>
</div>

The figure shows two cases\. When there are 20 observations\, n > p and the OLS line does not perfectly fit the data\. When there are only two observations\, then regardless of the values of those observations\, the regression line will fit the data exactly\. This is problematic because this perfect fit will almost certainly lead to overfitting of the data\.

</div>

::: {.notes}

Example: A marketing analyst interested in understanding people’s online shopping patterns could treat as features all of the search terms entered by users of a search engine. This is sometimes known as the "bag-ofwords" model. The same researcher might have access to the search histories of only a few hundred or a few thousand search engine users who have consented to share their information with the researcher. For a given user, each of the p search terms is scored present (0) or absent (1), creating a large binary feature vector. Then n ≈ 1,000 and p is much larger.


:::


---


## Handling High\-Dimensionality \(II\)

<div style="font-size:1.3em;font-weight:600;">
The figure illustrates the risk of applying OLS when the number of features p is large\. The model R2 increases to 1 as the number of features increases\, and the training set MSE decreases to 0\. At the same time\, the MSE on a test set becomes extremely large as the number of features increases\.

<div style="text-align:center">
![](images/slides_307.png)
</div>

In contrast\, methods like ridge regression are particularly useful for performing regression in the high\-dimensional setting\. Essentially\, these approaches avoid overfitting by using a less flexible fitting approach than least squares\.

## Support Vector Regression

<div style="font-size:1.5em;font-weight:600;">
Similar to the other regression approaches, Support Vector Regression estimates the parameters of the function:

## Using Neural Network for Regression

<div style="font-size: 1.6em; font-weight:700;">
Artificial neural networks are often used for classification because of the relationship to logistic regression\. Neural networks typically use a logistic activation function and output values from 0 to 1 like logistic regression\.

But  the continuous output of a net must not be interpreted as a probability\, so neural networks can be used too for regression\, to model complex and non\-linear relationships\.

The Singlelayer Perceptron corresponds to a linear regression while a Multilayer Perceptron is able to approximate nearly any function regard\-less of the complexity and nonlinearity\.

Because of the high complexity of the MLP\, the models are usually very sensitive and have a tendency to overfitting\.

There exist regularization methods\, which make the networks better at generalizing beyond the training data\.\(see http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning\.com/chap3\.html\)

## Regression Trees


<div style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight:700;">
<p>
Some of the tree approaches can be used for regression too\. They can be used for nonlinear multiple regression\. The output must be numerical\.

<div style="width:60%">
<p>
The figure shows a regression tree for predicting the salary of a baseball player\, based on the number of years that he has played in the major leagues and the number of hits that he made in the previous year\.
</p>
<p>
The predicted salary is given by the mean value of the salaries in the corresponding leaf\, e\.g\. for the players in the data set with Years<4\.5\, the mean \(log\-scaled\) salary is 5\.11\, and so we make a prediction of e5\.11 thousands of dollars\, i\.e\. $165\,670\, for these players\.
</p>
</div>
</div>

Players with Years>=4\.5 are assigned to the right branch\, and then that group is further subdivided by Hits\. The predicted salaries for the resulting two groups are 1\,000\*e6\.00 =$403\,428 and 1\,000\*e6\.74 =$845\,346\.

## Constructing a Regression Tree \(II\)

</p>
<p>After splitting, we repeat the process, looking for the best feature and best cutpoint in order to split the data further so as to minimize the RSS within each of the resulting regions.</p>
<p>The process continues until a stopping criterion is reached; for instance, we may continue until no region contains more than five observations.</p>
<p>Once the regions R<sub>1</sub>, . . . , R<sub>J</sub> have been created, we predict the objects from the test set.

## Random Forests for Regression

<div style="font-weight:600;font-size:1.6em">
Due to the usage of means as predictors a regression tree usually simplifies the true relationship between the inputs and the output\. The advantage over traditional statistical methods is\, that it can give valuable insights about which variables are important and where\. But the prediction ability is poor compared to other regression approaches\.

A much better prediction quality can be achieved with the creation of an ensemble of trees\, use them for prediction and averaging their results\. This is done\, when applying the Random Forests approach to a regression task\.

Regression Forests are an ensemble of different regression trees and are used for nonlinear multiple regression\. The principle is the same as in classification\, except that the output is not the result of a voting but instead of an averaging process\.

The disadvantage of Random Forests is that the analysis\, which aggregates over the results of many bootstrap trees\, does not produce a single\, easily interpretable tree diagram\.

## Limitations of Tree Methods in Regression

<div style="font-weight:600;font-size:1.6em">
When applied to regression problems\, tree methods have the limitation that they cannot exceed the range of values of the target variable used in training\. The reason for this lies in their design principle\, how the leaves of the trees are created\.

Thus\, Random Forests may perform poorly when the target data is out of the range of the original training data\, e\.g\. in the case of data with persistent trends\. A solution may be a frequent re\-training in this case\.

An important strength of Random Forests is that they are able to perform still well in the case of missing data\. According to their construction principle\, not every tree is using the same features\.

If there is any missing value for a feature during the application there usually are enough trees remaining that do not use this feature to produce accurate predictions\.

## k\-Nearest Neighbors for Regression

<div style="font-weight:600;font-size:1.6em">
<p>
k\-Nearest Neighbors cannot only be used for classification but also for regression\. The only difference in regression is that the prediction is not the result of a majority vote but of an averaging process\.
</p>
<div style="width:50%;float:left">
<p>
A simple implementation of KNN regression is to calculate the average of the numerical target of the k\-nearest neighbors\.  Another approach uses an inverse distance weighted average of the K\-nearest neighbors\. KNN regression uses the same distance functions as KNN classification\.

## Introductory Example

<div style="font-weight:600;font-size:1.4em">
Assume you are a wholesale distributor and each row of your dataset corresponds to a customer showing the following attributes:

<ol style="font-weight:400;font-size:0.7em">
  <li>FRESH : annual spending on fresh products (Continuous)</li>
  <li>MILK : annual spending on milk products (Continuous)</li>
  <li>GROCERY : annual spending on grocery products (Continuous)</li>
  <li>FROZEN : annual spending on frozen products (Continuous)</li>
  <li>DETERGENTS_PAPER : annual spending on detergents and paper products (Continuous)</li>
  <li>DELICATESSEN : annual spending on delicatessen products (Continuous)</li>
  <li>CHANNEL : customers buying channel (Nominal)</li>
  <li>REGION : customers region (Nominal)</li>
</ol>

Your goal is to segment the users\. That means finding similar types of users and bunching them together\.

Why would you want to do this?

 ● You might want to give different users different experiences\. Marketing often does this; for example\, to offer toner to people who are known to own printers\.

 ● You might have a model that works better for specific groups\. Or you might have different models for different groups\.

A dendrogram is a tree diagram frequently used to illustrate the arrangement of the clusters produced by hierarchical clustering\. The y\-axis represents the value of this distance metric \(e\.g\. euclidean distance\) between the clusters\.

In a dendrogram the widths of the horizontal lines give an impression about the dissimilarity of the merging object\. Thus\, a good cluster number might be at a point from where the width of the following horizontal lines is significantly smaller in length\. The red line in the graph below shows such a point:

Counting the points that cut this line might be a good answer for the number of clusters the data can have\. It is the number 6 in this case\.
